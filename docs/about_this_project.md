# PV FDD Project for Vasakronan

This project is done as part of a summer internship for summer 2022. The goal of the project is to give Vasakronan tools in fault detection and diagnostics on their PV. 
## How does it work?
Through machine learning - namely random forest regression - some models have been generated to predict the PV output given the irradiation in said location. This predicted PV output can then be used to analyze and understand the output of the individual PV plants. The main area of usage for this application is in detecting faulty PV through the machine learning algorithm - giving some alerts when the actually generated PV is lower than the predicted PV generation.
